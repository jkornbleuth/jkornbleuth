<h1>Carbonara</h1>

<p> The origins of Carbonara is a mystery. Some believe it was created by men working outdoors as it is derived from the word "carbonaro" meaning "coal burner". Others believe the dish was created when American soldiers would bring their eggs and bacon to restaurants to add to limited Italian menus. Carbonara is made using Spaghetti, Pancetta or Bacon, Eggs, Parmesean Cheese, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Carbonara is one of my favorites because I like pasta with a white creamy sauce and it goes very well with red wine. </p>
